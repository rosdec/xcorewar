This is an implementation of Corewar: the description of the language is here http://www.koth.org/info/guide.html. Read it only if I ask you to modify the emulated language

This is a deno/fresh project. Separate components to island where needed. 

The execution environment is deno with hot reload: so you do not need to restart the environment once the modifications are accepted. 

I'll debug in the browser, so don't need to write test/debugging script.

Don't describe what you've just done. Just write "Done." when finished, I'll ask more if I need explainations.

No emojis in code or text generated in any case.
